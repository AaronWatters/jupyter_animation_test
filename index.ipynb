    "# An experiment with Javascript animations using \"classic\" and \"lab\" Jupyter interfaces\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two interfaces for Jupyter currently available:\n",
    "\n",
    " - \"Classic notebook\" displays each notebook in a separate browser frame.\n",
    " - \"Jupyter Lab\" displays all notebooks in the same browser frame.\n",
    " \n",
    " This repository illustrates some\n",
    " difficulties with Javascript based animations that occur in the \"Lab\" approach\n",
    " which do not occur in the \"classic\" approach.\n",
    " \n",
    " - \"classic\" animations stop running when the frame is not in view, whereas\n",
    " \"lab\" animations always run even if the notebook tab is not on top.\n",
    " \n",
    " - \"classic\" animations terminate when the notebook is closed, whereas the\n",
    " example animations presented here do not terminate when the notebook is \"closed\"\n",
    " in the lab interface even though they are no longer visible.\n",
    " (It may be possible to add code to force the animation\n",
    " to detect that it should stop but at the moment I don't know how to do that.)\n",
    " \n",
    " ## The animation\n",
    " \n",
    " This experiment launches several copies of a \"rotating sphere\" animation in separate notebook.\n",
    " \n",
    " <img src=\"sphere.png\" width=\"200px\">\n",
    " \n",
    " The animation uses a fair amount Javascript based computations to present a moving\n",
    " 3 dimensional object on a 2 dimensional HTML canvas. It does not use WebGL.\n",
    " \n",
    " ## Testing \"classic\" notebooks\n",
    " \n",
    " For the experiment I use Chrome on a Macintosh and I open\n",
    " <a href=\"https://www.lifewire.com/google-chrome-task-manager-4103619\">Chrome task manager</a>\n",
